### What is CodeRPG?

CodeRPG is a VS Code extension that tracks your coding activity and helps you understand your programming habits. It monitors your keystrokes and calculates the time you spend actively coding, along with the number of actions you perform. This information can be used to:

Gain insights into your coding workflow: Identify periods of high activity and potential time sinks.
Track your progress over time: Monitor your coding time and effort invested in different projects.
Set goals and stay motivated: Use the tracked data to set achievable coding goals and stay motivated throughout your development journey.

### Key Features
